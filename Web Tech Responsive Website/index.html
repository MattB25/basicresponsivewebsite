					<p> Anfield was first the home to Everton FC, but due to a falling out over the rent, Everton moved to Goodison Park and a new team was formed to play at Anfield, called Liverpool FC. The stadium has 4 stands: The Kop, The Main Stand, Centenary Stand and Anfield Road. The ground was turned into an all seated stadium in 1994 which reduced the capacity. The ground has recently undergone an extension to the Main stand which increased it's capacity by 8,250.

					<img id="lfckit3rd" src= "Images/lfckit3rd.png" alt="lfcthird" height= "100" width= "100"/>
					<p> For pretty much all of Liverpools history, their kit has been red, but when the club was founded, they used a blue and white quartered kit. Liverpool changed into a fully red kit in 1964, when Bill Shankley decided that red would mean danger and power, the kit has been all red ever since. Liverpools away kit has mostly been yellow or white shirts with black shorts, but through their history they have changed to colours such as grey, black and even green. The away kit today is a black shirt with a white collar, with the third kit being a lime green color, with grey on the shoulders. Liverpool were the first English professional club to have a sponsors logo on its shirts, their deal with Carlsberg is the longest lasting agreement in English top flight football.
